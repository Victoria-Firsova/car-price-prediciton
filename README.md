# Goal - model of classification for cars by price category

We will be working with a small data sampling of used vehicles for re-saling in the United States, represented in the file *data/vehicles_dataset.csv*. Based on this data, we will create a classification model that determines the price category of a used car depending on the characteristics of the vehicle.
